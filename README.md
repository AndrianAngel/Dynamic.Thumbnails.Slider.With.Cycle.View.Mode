🔥🔥 Dynamic Thumbnails Slider with Cycle View Mode 🔥🔥

🌿⚡ This AutoHotkey-based utility offers a sleek, real-time GUI overlay for controlling Windows Explorer view modes and thumbnail sizes. Designed for power users and customization enthusiasts, it includes three modular scripts—each with compiled .exe and editable .ahk versions—for flexible deployment and integration.

🌹🔧 Features Overview 🌹

- Dynamic Thumbnail Resizing  
  A horizontal slider lets you adjust thumbnail size from 16px to 256px in real time. The slider is:
  - Visually enhanced with a bright blue 3x-thick slider line
  - Topped with a bright red thumb indicator for precise control
  - Accompanied by a live size display (e.g., Size: 215px) that updates instantly

- Explorer View Mode Controls  
  Five intuitive buttons allow you to switch between:
  - Large Thumbnails
  - Tiles
  - Details
  - List
  - Cycle (automatically rotates through modes)

- Global Hotkeys
  - Ctrl+W: Cycles view mode even when GUI is hidden
  - Ctrl+F12: Toggles GUI visibility on/off

- Explorer Integration  
  Uses COM automation to apply view changes directly to active Explorer windows. If COM fails, fallback keystrokes (Ctrl+Shift+2, etc.) ensure reliability.

- Notification System  
  Lightweight toast-style popups confirm actions like mode changes or thumbnail size updates.
